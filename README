Inptools allows to work with EPANET INP files.

See http://epanet.de/inptools for additional information.

Compilation

inp2shp and inpproj require a patched version of the EPANET Toolkit.
You can find such a patched version under https://github.com/sdteffen/epanet2
One option to compile on Windows: Build the commandline tools using MinGW.
The second option is to cross-compile on Linux, using the mingw32 package. 
You'll find Makefile targets for the individual executables in the Makefile 
generated by Automake. Instead of installing libepanet2 and libshp, you should
use the configure options --with-epanet-src and --with-shapelib-src to 
specify the location of the sources in that case.
